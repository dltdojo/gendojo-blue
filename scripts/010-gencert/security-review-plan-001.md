# Security Review Report: gencert.sh

**Script:** `scripts/010-gencert/gencert.sh`  
**Review Date:** 2024-08-23  
**Reviewer:** Security Assessment Bot  
**Version:** v1.0

## Executive Summary

The `gencert.sh` script is a certificate generation utility that creates a Certificate Authority (CA) and server certificates using OpenSSL. While the script uses modern cryptographic algorithms, several security concerns have been identified that could impact the confidentiality and integrity of generated certificates and private keys.

## Security Assessment Results

### Critical Issues (需立即修復)

**None identified**

### High Severity Issues (高優先級修復)

#### H001: No Secure Key Storage
**Severity:** High  
**Category:** Cryptographic Security  
**Location:** Lines 34, 38

**Issue Description:**
Private keys are stored in plaintext without any encryption or passphrase protection.

**Risk Impact:**
- Keys are vulnerable if file system is compromised
- No protection against accidental exposure
- Compliance issues with security standards

**Remediation:**
Consider implementing passphrase protection for production use:
```bash
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey | openssl ec -aes256 -out ca.key
```

### Medium Severity Issues (中等優先級修復)

#### M001: Fixed Certificate Validity Period
**Severity:** Medium  
**Category:** Configuration Management  
**Location:** Lines 35, 63

**Issue Description:**
Certificate validity is hard-coded to 365 days without configuration options.

**Risk Impact:**
- No flexibility for different security requirements
- Potential service disruption due to unexpected expiration
- Difficulty in certificate lifecycle management

**Remediation:**
Add configurable validity period:
```bash
CERT_DAYS=${CERT_DAYS:-365}
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca.key -out ca.crt -days "$CERT_DAYS"
```

#### M002: Temporary Configuration Files in Working Directory
**Severity:** Medium  
**Category:** Information Disclosure  
**Location:** Lines 17-31, 41-58

**Issue Description:**
Configuration files (`ca.cnf`, `server.cnf`) are created in the current working directory and may persist if script fails.

**Risk Impact:**
- Configuration details may be exposed
- Potential information leakage about certificate structure
- File system pollution

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Create temporary files with proper cleanup
TEMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
trap "rm -rf '$TEMP_DIR'" EXIT
```

#### M003: No Input Validation for Certificate Subjects
**Severity:** Medium  
**Category:** Input Validation  
**Location:** Lines 24, 48

**Issue Description:**
Certificate subject names are hard-coded without validation or configuration options.

**Risk Impact:**
- Limited flexibility for different environments
- Potential for certificate misuse
- Compliance issues with organizational naming standards

**Remediation:**
Add environment variable support:
```bash
CA_SUBJECT=${CA_SUBJECT:-"My CA"}
SERVER_SUBJECT=${SERVER_SUBJECT:-"localhost"}
```

### Low Severity Issues (低優先級修復)

#### L001: Insufficient Error Context
**Severity:** Low  
**Category:** Operational Security  
**Location:** Various lines

**Issue Description:**
Error messages don't provide sufficient context for troubleshooting while maintaining security.

**Risk Impact:**
- Difficulty in debugging issues
- Potential for operational mistakes

**Remediation:**
Add more descriptive error handling:
```bash
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out ca.key || {
    echo "Failed to generate CA private key" >&2
    exit 1
}
```

#### L002: Serial Number Predictability
**Severity:** Low  
**Category:** Cryptographic Security  
**Location:** Line 62

**Issue Description:**
Certificate serial number is set to a predictable value (1000).

**Risk Impact:**
- Potential for certificate collision in larger deployments
- Reduced cryptographic entropy

**Remediation:**
```bash
# Generate random serial number
openssl rand -hex 16 > ca.srl
```

### Informational Items (資訊性建議)

#### I001: Strong Cryptographic Algorithms
**Status:** Good  
**Location:** Lines 34, 38, 63

The script correctly uses:
- ECDSA with P-256 curve (strong elliptic curve)
- SHA-256 hash algorithm
- Appropriate certificate extensions

#### I002: Certificate Extensions Configuration
**Status:** Good  
**Location:** Lines 26-30, 50-57

Proper certificate extensions are configured:
- CA certificates have appropriate constraints
- Server certificates include Subject Alternative Names (SANs)
- Key usage extensions are properly set

#### I003: Secure File Permissions
**Status:** Good  
**Location:** Lines 34, 38

The script correctly creates private keys with secure file permissions (600), restricting access to the owner only.

## Compliance Considerations

### Security Standards
- **NIST Guidelines**: Compliant with NIST SP 800-57 for key sizes
- **OWASP**: Needs improvement for secure key storage
- **ISO 27001**: Requires enhanced access controls

### Industry Best Practices
- Use of modern cryptographic algorithms ✓
- Certificate lifecycle management needs improvement
- Key protection mechanisms need enhancement

## Recommended Security Enhancements

### Priority 1 (Immediate)
1. Add proper temporary file handling with cleanup
2. Add configuration options for certificate validity

### Priority 2 (Short-term)
1. Implement input validation for certificate subjects
2. Enhance error handling and logging
3. Implement random serial number generation

### Priority 3 (Long-term)
1. Consider Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration
2. Implement certificate revocation capabilities
3. Add automated certificate renewal mechanisms

## Testing Recommendations

### Security Testing
```bash
# Test file permissions
ls -la *.key
# Should show 600 permissions

# Test certificate validation
openssl verify -CAfile ca.crt server.crt

# Test cryptographic strength
openssl x509 -in server.crt -noout -text | grep "Signature Algorithm"
```

### Penetration Testing Focus Areas
1. File permission bypass attempts
2. Certificate chain validation
3. Key extraction attempts
4. Temporary file race conditions

## Conclusion

The `gencert.sh` script demonstrates good cryptographic practices but requires security enhancements, particularly around key protection and file handling. The identified issues should be addressed according to their priority levels to ensure robust certificate security.
